## Conclusions
As per the debit to income ratio, 

To the applicants with low salary, high loan amount requirement, high debt to salary ratio, higher grade of debt and higher term requirement, we can approve a loan of an amount not to high but with a high interest as they are very high risky applicants
To the applicants with medium salary, medium loan amount requirement, medium debt to salary ratio, medium grade of debt and medium to low term requirement, we can lend a slightly higher loan amount and a slightly lower interest rate than the highly risky applicants
To the applicants with high salary, low loan requirement, low debt to salary ratio, low grade of debt and with a low term requirement, we can lend a higher amount as required with a standard or low interest rates as they are the least risky applicants
